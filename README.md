# Retired XUL Platform (RXP)

This repository holds the code for a retired (from our perspective, obviously it persists at upstream) application platform for XUL-based
applications. 

## Why?

Reference, example, shuffleboard, accessing an old profile, tinkering on things like the Borealis Navigator which is not only the most popular BinOC Project despite being vaporware (since it has never been released) but also somehow has a tangibly existing downstream ecosystem, which seems impossible. Also, people seemed to like Interlink too. Well now YOU can build 'em and give them a future in part or in full, sans branding of course. Though, I may be persuaded by passion, commitment, and good old fasioned American dollars to part with my beloved brands. Inquire if you care unless you don't.

## Should I be using it?

Maybe, it depends. Perhaps you should check out thereisonlyxul.org before making that decision. There are quite a number of UXP applications there already.

## Isn't this all old and insecure?

Only as old and insecure as the Unified XUL Platform, and that IS properly security patched. If those patches are in this tree when you build? It's likely secure enough but this is why it depends ;)

## But I want old stuff on even older stuff like XP?

Then get to it. I'd consider a branch for a legit effort but I'd only be doing overview and seeing if it breaks levels of testing, when I get around to it. So if you bust the tree, you have to fix it. Same goes for other os as well. Other than Windows and Linux that is.

## How do I build it cause you aren't doing exactly what *they* do?

All in good time. My spare time. See: https://github.com/binaryoutcast/markIII-dev for the FUTURE!
